   - Visualize collaboration networks to optimize team structures and improve information flow.

2. **Culture Mapping**
   - Analyze employee feedback, communications, and behaviors to generate comprehensive culture maps.
   - Identify subcultures within the organization and track cultural evolution over time.

3. **Predictive Attrition Modeling**
   - Develop GenAI models to predict employee turnover risks based on various factors.
   - Generate personalized retention strategies for high-risk employees.

4. **Engagement Forecasting**
   - Use GenAI to predict future engagement levels based on current trends and planned initiatives.
   - Generate scenarios to test the potential impact of different HR policies on employee engagement.

### Implementation Strategy:
- Start with anonymized data to address privacy concerns and build trust.
- Combine AI insights with qualitative feedback from managers and employees for a holistic view.
