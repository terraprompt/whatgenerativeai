**Info Box: Past Technology Predictions and Their Accuracy - Lessons for GenAI**

Historical technology predictions offer valuable insights for anticipating the future of GenAI:

1. **1943**: Thomas Watson, IBM Chairman, predicts a world market for "maybe five computers." This massive underestimation reminds us to think big about AI's potential impact.

2. **1977**: Ken Olsen, founder of Digital Equipment Corporation, states, "There is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home." This highlights the importance of considering unexpected use cases for AI.

3. **1995**: Robert Metcalfe, inventor of Ethernet, predicts the internet will "catastrophically collapse" in 1996. This underscores the need to balance skepticism with openness to transformative technologies.

4. **2007**: Steve Ballmer, Microsoft CEO, claims, "There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share." This emphasizes the potential for AI to create entirely new markets and transform user experiences.

5. **2011**: Marc Andreessen declares that "software is eating the world," accurately predicting the digital transformation across industries. This suggests that AI could have a similarly pervasive impact.
